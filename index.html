                <article>
                    <h3>Why do people wear makeup?</h3>
                    <p>The answer lies in what it does to a person’s overall appearance. It is the perception of those around us that makes makeup application such an important part of many of our daily routines. People have found that certain makeup techniques alter one’s perception about you and that makes it worth it.</p>
                    <p>There is a reason why makeup is worn and why it is so popular. Researchers think that we are born with some detectors of beauty. They believe that we naturally seek out appealing faces regardless of our upbringing or culture. Studies that look at how people perceive attractiveness, concluded that a symmetrical face is important. They also show how a youthful face is more attractive than an older one. This is most important when choosing a mate, because an older look portrays the idea that a mate is too old to bear children and continue the line.</p>
                    <p>Until men and women hit puberty, their faces are very similar. When a man hits puberty, testosterone starts to angle their faces and make their noses and brows more prominent.</p>
                    <p>When a woman hits puberty, they have prominent cheekbones, longer lashes, plumper lips, smaller noses, and because their brows are not prominent, larger eyes.</p>
                    <p>Makeup helps show an absence of the male hormones by enhancing the feminine features. Mascara, eyeliners, and eye shadows enhance the eyes and make them look larger on the face.
                Blush accentuates the cheekbones and makes them look higher and more pronounced. Lipstick enhances the plump lips and make them more defined. Foundations and concealers give smooth skin and can emulate youth.</p>
                    <p>To recap, makeup is used to enhance the look of our features for the purpose of causing a response in others and making us feel good about ourselves. However, like an artist paints a painting, it is important to make sure that the makeup artist paints a beautiful portrait on the face. That is why it is so important to learn techniques.</p>
                    <p>Someone with no knowledge of makeup can pull it off and it may enhance their attributes slightly. However, a makeup artist can totally transform a person by accentuating every attribute.</p>
                    <p><strong>Here are some of the top techniques that are used and why they are so powerful.</strong><p>
                    <h3>Red Lipstick</h3>
                    <p>Red lips are a sign of prowess, assertiveness, and authority. There have been studies conducted on the male response and perception of women wearing red lipstick. Men will spend 7.3 seconds more looking at a woman’s lips when they are wearing red lipstick.</p>
                    <p>Look through a magazine and try to find your favorite models and actresses wearing different shades of lipstick. Find one where they are wearing a deep red lipstick and then one where they are wearing a more neutral color. You will notice a huge difference. The red lipstick draws your attention to the lips and makes them look supple and perfect.</p>
                    <h3>Bright Eyes</h3>
                    <p>Makeup techniques can give the perception that the eyes are bigger. The idea is to get that big ‘Bambi-eyed’ look which makes the whites look brighter and opens up your eyes. You can have a daytime look and a night look. During the day, the focus is to hide imperfections while still looking natural. Your night time appearance is one that accentuates the features.</p>
                    <h3>Luscious Lashes</h3>
                    <p>Back in Roman times, a set of full and luscious curled lashes was considered a sign of enhancement, desire, and purity. It was thought that the eyelashes of a woman would fall out after they had many sexual encounters. Therefore, women needed to have lush lashes to prove their chastity.</p>
                    <p>Full lashes also help accentuate the eyes and make them look bigger.
                Mascara can be used to lengthen, separate, and add volume to the eyelashes. It draws attention to your eyes and when it is paired with eyeliner and eye shadow, it gives you a polished look. When mascara is applied correctly, it can make the eyelash look longer and thicker.</p>
                    <h3>Smooth skin and flush cheeks</h3>
                    <p>Health and beauty go hand in hand.</p>
                    <p>The first things that you notice when you look at someone are their skin, lips, and eyes. Skin that is glowing and cheeks that are rosy portray health and youth. The rosy cheeks give a sense of innocence, beauty, and sensuality.</p>
                    <p>As long as you don’t go overboard so that you look as if you are blushing, these rosy cheeks will enhance your look. Not to mention that the blush accentuates the cheekbones and make them look higher. It pulls the focus to the eyes and gives the person a youthful and feminine look.</p>
                    <h3>Foundation and Concealer</h3>
                    <p>You can cover up your imperfections with a good concealer and foundation. However, they can do more than just that.</p>
                    <p>They give your skin a youthful look and make your face look clear and blemish-free, which translates into an appearance of health as well. Nobody likes unsightly spots, red and blotchy skin, and other facial imperfections. The use of a foundation and a concealer give you the opportunity to create a clean slate. They hide the imperfections, fill in fine lines and some wrinkles, and present clean and glowing skin.</p>
                    <p>The concealer is an essential part of the process because it covers up the areas that you find imperfect. It is great for filling in those lines around your lips and eyes. It covers up the blemishes. Overall, concealer is the wonder product that gives you the look of smooth and youthful skin. However, it can’t act alone. The foundation needs to be applied next to create the smooth canvas and even tone. The foundation is great for an even toned skin. It works well when it is matched with your skin color. The idea is to get it as close to your skin color as possible. This may be different during different times of the year. For example, skin is usually darker in the summer because of the exposure to the sun. Over the year, it fades and is lighter. Keep this in mind when you are applying foundation. You want to be able to blend it in nicely into the neck.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that the overall purpose of wearing concealer and foundation is to look natural. You don’t want to cake so much on that it is visible. You don’t want to get a shade that is so much darker or lighter than your natural color that it is noticeable either.</p>

                    <code><strong>When you think of makeup artistry, you are likely to be thinking about elaborate designs.</strong></code>
                    <p>That is definitely a form of art; however, makeup artistry can look natural and be considered art as well.</p>
                        <code>“Beauty is often perceived as one of the most pleasant aspects of life.” (Afable, Abigail M., Quiambao, Micaela Marie, Robinos, Kimberly, & Villapana, Raffy Jay C., n.d.).</code>
                    <p>There are many people that take their appearance seriously and spend a lot of time maintaining it. The idea is to change other’s overall perception of them. Self-perceived attractiveness is important and because of that many people have incorporated cosmetics into their lives to enhance their beauty.</p>
                    <p>Cosmetics have become a mark of womanhood and maturity.
                        Women of all ages partake in the use of cosmetics to enhance their appearance.</p>
                    <p>An older woman tends to wear makeup to capture her youth and a younger woman wears it to give her a confidence boost. Much of our health and mood comes from our perception of ourselves. Therefore, when we are wearing makeup, it gives us the confidence that we need to feel great.</p>
                    <p>Older women tend to wear makeup to hide the fine lines and wrinkles that are starting to appear. With the right application, these women can knock years off their appearance, making them look considerably younger. At the same time, younger women are trying to look older, more sophisticated and elegant. Makeup helps them achieve this goal, making them feel better about themselves.</p>
                    <p>It is likely that modern advertisements of celebrities with their perfect complexions create the feelings of inadequacy that lead many people to not be able to leave the house without doing their makeup first. However, the history behind makeup far exceeds modern fashion and television. Makeup has been around since ancient times.</p>
                    <p>Some studies have looked at the use of makeup as a way to cover up an imperfection; however, this may be something that only applies to some of the women who wear makeup. The idea that the use of makeup can improve overall health and well-being supersedes these desires to just look better. There is nothing that says that these perfect celebrities don’t influence and drive the market forward. But to believe this is the sole push negates the decades of use prior to our modern-day celebrities.</p>
                    <p>In addition to all of this, makeup has many benefits, from boosting confidence to protecting the skin.</p>
                    <p>Most makeup products these days have sun protection built in; this can protect the skin against the harmful sun’s rays, reducing the risk of skin cancer in the future. Makeup also helps to enhance the facial features. If the client has beautiful full lips or large eyes, these can be a focal point on the face if makeup is used correctly. Furthermore, makeup is fun! It can be experimented with and there is a wide variety to choose from to make a lasting impression.</p>
